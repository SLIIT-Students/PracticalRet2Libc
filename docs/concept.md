Presentation and Tutorial Concept
---------------------------------

This presentation is designed to be a gentle introduction to return oriented
programming techniques in binary exploitation by demonstrating a subset of the
art called Return2Libc. Currently, the level of exploitation taught by the class
only includes the classic stack overflow and jump to shellcode with no
protections enabled. We wish to build upon this knowledge and introduce methods
to perform a successful attack when more protections are enabled (NX, Stack
Canaries, ASLR).
